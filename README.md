# MeshNormalComputation
for a 3D triangular mesh given as a numpy array, with an associated list of vertices's position given asa numpy array, we computed the normal associated with each vertex, and with each face (given the constraint the the normals should be directed outside of the face) ) 


Complete explanation of the algorithm will be added later
